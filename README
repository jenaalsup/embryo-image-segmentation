## Human Embryo Image Segmentation
Spring 2025 - Zernicka-Goetz Lab

----------------------
How to run
----------------------

Macros:
- segment-nuclei.ijm (paste this into a fiji macro - segments the original image and saves coordinates, aspect ratio of each nuclei to a csv)
     --> note: use the same script to segment bra+, but change the channel to 2, update the output path, and adjust the threshold
- segment-factin-outline.ijm (paste this into a fiji macro - segments the f-actin channel of the image and saves the outline to a csv)

Python Scripts:
- `python3 boxplot-aspect-ratio.py` (generates boxplot of aspect ratio of nuclei in day 2 and day 3)
- `python3 plot-curvature-dist.py` (generates 2 plots: (1) scatterplot of curvature vs. nuclear aspect ratio by day 2 and day and (2) smoothed histogram of curvature frequencies by day 2 and day 3) 
- `python3 compare-fitted-ellipses.py` (generates plots that compare segmenting the f-actin vs nuclei centroids)
- `python3 plot-brac-curvature-dist.py` (generates 3 plots: (1) example classification of brac nuclei in a d3 structure, (2) scatterplot of aspect ratio vs curvature by brac status, and (3) smoothed histogram of curvature frequencies by bracyhury pos or neg status)
- `python3 new-compare-fitted-ellipses.py` (generates plots that compare segmenting the f-actin vs nuclei centroids on the new data that has the inner membrane, needed a different file for this because the zoom etc is very different)


----------------------
Data (CSVs)
----------------------

- Stored in the /data folder 
- This all comes directly from running the Fiji macros
- Each CSV file is labeled with the name of the day, slice, and series
- The file name ends with '_new' if it is from one of the following more recent files:
     --> SHEF6N2_D2N20-3dE_G3_DAPI_Factin-488_Bry-568_Sox2-647.lif
     --> SHEF6N2_D3N20-3dE_G3_DAPI_Factin-488_Bry-568_Sox2-647.lif
- The file name does NOT end with '_new' if it is from one of the following older files:
     --> 05032025_Shef6WT_D2_Ctrl-3dE_G3_DAPI_Factin-488_Bry-568_Sox2-647.lif
     --> 05032025_Shef6WT_D3_Ctrl-3dE_DAPI_Factin-488_Bry-568_Sox2-647.lif
- /plotting-data subfolder stores the data used in the graphs (e.g. curvature vs frequency plotted in the distribution smoothed histogram)


----------------------
Images
----------------------

- Stored in the /images folder
- /eps subfolder stores the eps versions of each of the plots (they have the same name but use the eps extension instead of png)
